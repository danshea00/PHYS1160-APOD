    <h3 class="heading">Jupiter</h3>
    <p>
      Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system. One of the four Jovian
      planets in our solar system, the gas giant is named after the Roman king
      of gods, Jupiter. The planet’s observation was first recorded by
      Babylonian astronomers as early as the 8th century BC (Sachs, 1974). To
      the Babylonians, the planet represented the god Marduk (Rogers, 1998).
      Jupiter’s orbital period of just under 12 years is the basis for both the
      Babylonian and Chinese zodiacs (Dubs, 1958). Since these early
      observations, and with the technological advancements that have allowed
      for space exploration, we have gained a much clearer picture of Jupiter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jupiter has a semi-major axis of approximately 5.2 AU and an eccentricity
      of 0.0489. With a volume of 143128e10 km^3, Jupiter is 1321 times larger
      than Earth, despite being only 318 times more massive. The planet is
      composed of mostly hydrogen and helium, with a composition of 89% and 10%
      by volume respectively (NASA, 2018). This proportion of hydrogen and
      helium is close to the composition of the primordial solar nebula. Jupiter
      is often referred to as a “failed star” as it has the right composition to
      be a star, but is not massive enough to fuse hydrogen into helium.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jupiter's gravity is shaped by its rotation and atmospheric movements.
      Measurements from Juno reveal a north-south gravitational asymmetry,
      pointing to internal and atmospheric activity (Iess et al, 2021).
    </p>
    <p>
      Discovered by Galileo, the planet has four moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede,
      and Callisto. The largest, Ganymede, is even larger than Mercury, and the
      smallest, Europa, is about as large as Earth’s moon. Io, Europa, and
      Ganymede orbit according to the Laplace resonance, with their orbital
      periods exhibiting a ratio of 4:2:1 respectively.

    <h3 class="heading">Jupiter’s Atmosphere</h3>
    <p>
      The atmosphere of Jupiter is very well understood after the Galileo
      atmospheric probe descended into the gas giant in 1995, measuring the
      temperature, pressure, gas composition, clouds, radiant energy, and
      lightning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main components of Jupiter’s atmosphere are molecular hydrogen and
      helium. The atmosphere also contains simple compounds such as water,
      ammonia, and hydrogen sulphide, as well as hydrocarbons as heavy as
      Benzene (Atreya, 2003). The atmosphere is divided into four layers: the
      troposphere, the stratosphere, the thermosphere, and the exosphere. Due to
      the high temperatures and pressures at the lowest layer of the atmosphere,
      there is a smooth transition between Jupiter’s liquid centre and the
      troposphere. The base of this layer is considered to be approximately 90
      km below the planets ‘surface’ of 1 bar, where the pressure reaches 10 bar
      (Seiff, 1998). The layer extends to 50 km beyond the planet’s surface,
      where temperatures decrease from 340 K to 110 K. The troposphere also
      contains cloud structures made of ammonia ice (Baines, 2002). It is these
      structures that create the red and white bands of Jupiter which can be
      seen from earth. The stratosphere extends beyond the tropopause, rising to
      an altitude of 320 km where pressures are 1 μbar. In this layer,
      temperatures increase to about 200 K at the transition to the
      thermosphere. The stratosphere hosts haze layers composed of condensed
      heavy hydrocarbons or hydrazine, generated from methane in the upper
      stratosphere. In the thermosphere, which extends beyond 1000 km,
      temperatures further rise to 800–1000 K. Notable phenomena in the
      thermosphere include airglow, polar aurorae, and X-ray emissions (Yelle
      and Miller, 2004). Layers of increased electron and ion density form the
      ionosphere within the thermosphere. The exosphere, located beyond
      approximately 5000 km above the surface, sees a gradual decrease in
      density. This outermost layer emits X-rays at the poles and low latitudes,
      with permanent aurorae encircling the poles (Bhardwaj and Gladstone,
      2000). Jupiter's atmosphere exhibits a complex and dynamic structure
      across the various layers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jupiter's atmosphere, primarily composed of molecular hydrogen and helium,
      exhibits a stratified structure with distinct layers, from the troposphere
      characterised by ammonia ice clouds to the thermosphere displaying
      phenomena such as airglow, polar aurorae, and X-ray emissions.

    <h3 class="heading">The Great Red Spot</h3>

    <p>
      Jupiter’s Great Red Spot is the largest anticyclonic storm in our solar
      system. The storm rotates anticlockwise and is located 22 degrees south of
      the equator. The Great Red Spot has existed since at least the 19th
      century, though it may have formed as early as 1665, however these
      observations could have been of a different storm. Figure X shows Donato
      Creti’s impression of a stormy Jupiter, painted in 1711. As detailed
      records exist since 1879, the size and drift of The Great Red Spot can be
      measured over many years (Simon, 2018). Anticyclones, with high pressure
      central regions, spin the opposite way to conventional cyclones, which
      have low pressure central regions. The stable nature of anticyclones in
      combination with the size, depth, and vorticity of The Great Red Spot,
      allows for the storm’s longevity (Sánchez‐Lavega, 2021).
    </p>
    <p>
      Analysis of the storm using microwave radiometry data from the Juno
      mission indicated that it is 200 to 500 km deep, extending to a base of
      240 km below the surface where pressures reach 100 bar (Parisi et al,
      2018). A more recent study determined that The Great Red Spot is more
      deeply rooted, with a depth of greater than 500 km (Cai et al, 2023). The
      storm’s colour has also changed over time, becoming more intensely orange
      over time. This is possibly correlated with a phenomenon known as ‘vortex
      stretching’ (Simon, 2018).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Great Red Spot has been observed to be shrinking in length since the
      1800s. Since 1987, when its length was 40,000 km, the storm has shrunk to
      a length of 15,000 km today (Sánchez‐Lavega, 2021). It currently continues
      to shrink at 0.194°/yr; a rate which will see the storm transition from
      oval to circular by 2040. The storm travels westward, at a rate that has
      increased since the 1980’s. Since 2014, the Great Red Spot has exhibited a
      diminishing reflectance in the short wavelength range (< 650 nm),
      accompanied by an increase in brightness at 890 nm. These changes suggest
      alterations in the composition of clouds or haze at elevated altitudes
      (Simon, 2018). From 2018 to 2020, the spot began to ‘flake’, with
      fragments dissipating at the edges of the storm. While there was
      speculation that the storm was beginning to dissipate, new research claims
      that these events were superficial, not affecting the entire depth of The
      Great Red Spot (Sánchez‐Lavega, 2021).
    </p>
    <p>
      Researchers have simulated stable 3-dimensional vortices within Jupiter's
      atmosphere. Two types were explored: "constant-vorticity," which are
      similar to Jupiter's Great Red Spot, and "constant-area" vortices. The
      simulation indicated stable vortices resembling the Great Red Spot emerged
      from the constant-vorticity type, while constant-area vortices proved
      unstable. Late-stage vortices exhibited unexpected features, including
      hollowing akin to the Great Red Spot and alignment with Jupiter's spin
      axis (Zhang, 2023).
    </p>
    <p>
      Jupiter's Great Red Spot has endured for centuries and presents a unique
      subject of study. Detailed observational records have allowed for a
      comprehensive analysis of its size, drift, and evolving characteristics.
      Recent research indicates a substantial depth, surpassing 500 km. The
      storm's colour transformation and the observed shrinking since the 1800s,
      coupled with altered reflectance and 'flaking' events, highlight the
      dynamic nature of the storm. Simulations of 3-dimensional vortices offer
      valuable insights into the stability and unexpected features of structures
      resembling the Great Red Spot within Jupiter's atmosphere.

      The first mission, Pioneer 10, studied Jupiter’s atmosphere and took the
      first close-up images of Jupiter and its moons. During this flyby mission,
      the spacecraft determined many properties including the rough composition
      of the planet and the fact that the magnetic field is the opposite to that
      of the Earth. The mission was the first spacecraft to escape the solar
      system.
    </p>
    <p>
      Voyager 1, the furthest man made object from earth, performed a gravity
      assist around Jupiter, gaining 10 km/s. During the manoeuvre, it captured
      close-up images of the atmosphere of Jupiter, including the APOD from the
      2nd of May 2011.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most recent mission, Juno, entered a polar orbit of Jupiter on the 5th
      of July, 2016. It studied the planet's gravitation and magnetism, as well
      as its winds and atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p>
      One upcoming ESA mission is Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE). Its
      instruments include the Ganymede Laser Altimeter (GALA), which utilises a
      laser to study the topography of icy moons and tidal deformations of
      Ganymede and the Sub-millimeter Wave Instrument (SWI), which utilizes a
      spectrometer to study Jupiter's stratosphere and troposphere, as well as
      the exospheres and surfaces of the icy moons.
